# WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT
This Repo is for keeping track of a project I am currently doing, and the idea is not entirely mine. It's for practice.
I started working on it from *4/02/2025*

---

## NOTES
This is for practice and I don't own the pictures or any other materials used in the development of this project/Website.They were just used to make the pages more lively.

---

### Added some JavaScript for functionality/Interactivity
For more interaction, a few lines of JavaScript code were necessary.

### NOTES
This is not complete yet, I am still working on it.
The files are incomplete, and some will be completed incrementally with time.
