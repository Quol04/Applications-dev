#  Website Development Project

This repository is dedicated to a personal project Iâ€™m currently working on. While the core concept is not entirely original, the project is intended for learning and practice purposes only.

>  Project Start Date: *February 4th, 2025*

##  Project Notes

- This project is **for educational purposes only**.
- All external assets, such as images or design inspirations, are used purely to enhance the visual quality of the site and are **not owned by me**.
- The current structure consists of two main folders. More may be added as development progresses.

###  JavaScript Integration

To add interactivity and basic functionality to the user interface, a small amount of JavaScript has been included. This helps bring the pages to life with dynamic behaviors.

##  Work in Progress

This project is **not yet complete**. Development is ongoing, and several files or sections are still under construction. Updates will be made incrementally as I continue learning and refining the site.
