# WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT
This Repo is for keeping track of a project I am currently doing, and the idea is not entirely mine. It's for practice.
I started working on it from *4/02/2025*

---

## NOTES
This is for practice, and I don't own the pictures or any other materials used to develop this project/Website. 

They were just used to make the pages more lively.

There are two folders for now

---

### Added some JavaScript for functionality/Interactivity
For more interaction, a few lines of JavaScript code were necessary.

### NOTES
This is not complete yet, I am still working on it.
The files are incomplete, and some will be completed incrementally with time.

## üìå Project Notes

- This project is **for educational purposes only**.
- All external assets, such as images or design inspirations, are used purely to enhance the visual quality of the site and are **not owned by me**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript Integration

To add interactivity and basic functionality to the user interface, a small amount of JavaScript has been included. This helps bring the pages to life with dynamic behaviors.

## üöß Work in Progress

This project is **not yet complete**. Development is ongoing, and several files or sections are still under construction. Updates will be made incrementally as I continue learning and refining the site.
